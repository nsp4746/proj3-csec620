# CSEC 620
# Project 3: ML for Security
This is Group 2, we tackled the Cybersecurity issue of Phishing in this project. We used Pytorch and  a pre-labeled and pre-generated dataset.

# Instructions to run
1. Install **python version 3.11.6**
2. Clone repo
3. Run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run model.py 

The model.py file contains three different approaches to the dataset.
* It contains a traditional deep learning neural network approach to the dataset
* A random forest classifier (implemented from sci-kit learn)
* A k-nearest neighbors classifier (implemented from sci-kit learn)

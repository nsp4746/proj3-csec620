	abstract = {Nowaday, emails are used in almost every field, from business to education. Emails have two subcategories, i.e., ham and spam. Email spam, also called junk emails or unwanted emails, is a type of email that can be used to harm any user by wasting his/her time, computing resources, and stealing valuable information. The ratio of spam emails is increasing rapidly day by day. Spam detection and filtration are significant and enormous problems for email and IoT service providers nowadays. Among all the techniques developed for detecting and preventing spam, filtering email is one of the most essential and prominent approaches. Several machine learning and deep learning techniques have been used for this purpose, i.e., Naïve Bayes, decision trees, neural networks, and random forest. This paper surveys the machine learning techniques used for spam filtering techniques used in email and IoT platforms by classifying them into suitable categories. A comprehensive comparison of these techniques is also made based on accuracy, precision, recall, etc. In the end, comprehensive insights and future research directions are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The risk of cyberattacks against businesses has risen considerably, with Business Email Compromise (BEC) schemes taking the lead as one of the most common phishing attack methods. The daily evolution of this assault mechanism’s attack methods has shown a very high level of proficiency against organisations. Since the majority of BEC emails lack a payloader, they have become challenging for organisations to identify or detect using typical spam filtering and static feature extraction techniques. Hence, an efficient and effective BEC phishing detection approach is required to provide an effective solution to various organisations to protect against such attacks. This paper provides a systematic review and examination of the state of the art of BEC phishing detection techniques to provide a detailed understanding of the topic to allow researchers to identify the main principles of BEC phishing detection, the common Machine Learning (ML) algorithms used, the features used to detect BEC phishing, and the common datasets used. Based on the selected search strategy, 38 articles (of 950 articles) were chosen for closer examination. Out of these articles, the contributions of the selected articles were discussed and summarised to highlight their contributions as well as their limitations. In addition, the features of BEC phishing used for detection were provided, as well as the ML algorithms and datasets that were used in BEC phishing detection models were discussed. In the end, open issues and future research directions of BEC phishing detection based on ML were discussed.},

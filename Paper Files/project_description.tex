\section{Project Description}

Phishing due to the introduction of large language models, has become more and more difficult to detect. Artifical Intelligence models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Meta's LLaMA can write highly detailed and highly personalized emails to phishing targets. As a result the necessity of a detection engine that is able to detect phishing emails has increased significantly. We have recognized this, and the goal of this project is to produce a model that is capable of detecting phishing emails with a high accuracy. In order to showcase the ability of machine learning in detection, we have also used K-nearest neighbors and Random Forest classification in order to see how different algorithms work on this dataset. The dataset was preassembled and prelabeled, and has many features. It examines the URL's parameters in the dataset, as well as the email headers to determine the legitmacy of the origin.
